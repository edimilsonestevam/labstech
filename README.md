# Technical Challenge: Software Engineer in Test :computer:
The increasing complexity of software systems demands innovative approaches to ensure their quality and reliability. In this context, test automation has become a fundamental practice for software development teams. Developing strong technical skills in this area is essential for professionals seeking to stand out in the current landscape.

<p>The technical challenge proposed for software test automation aims to assess participants' ability to deal with various aspects of the development life cycle, from understanding requirements to the efficient implementation of automated tests.

# Challenge Scope
**1. Requirements Analysis:** Participants will be provided with a set of software requirements. Their task is to conduct a thorough analysis of these requirements, identifying relevant test cases and critical scenarios.<br>
**2. Automation Strategy:** Based on the requirements analysis, participants must develop a comprehensive strategy for test automation. This includes choosing appropriate tools, defining the scope of automated tests, and creating a plan that considers aspects such as coverage, maintainability, and execution time.<br>
**3. Implementation of Automated Tests:** Participants will be challenged to implement automated test cases according to the defined strategy. This includes creating test scripts, configuring test data, and integrating with continuous execution environments.<br>
**4. Reports and Metrics:** In addition to executing automated tests, participants must implement an effective reporting system that provides insights into software performance in different aspects, such as code coverage, test success rate, and execution time.<br>
**5. Continuous Maintenance:** The challenge addresses the importance of continuous maintenance of automated tests. Participants will be evaluated based on their ability to handle changes in requirements and software while maintaining the robustness of automated tests over time.<br>

# Evaluation Criteria
* **Test Coverage:** Assessment of the extent of test coverage, considering edge cases and critical scenarios.<br>
* **Code Quality:** Analysis of clarity, modularity, and good programming practices in test scripts.<br>
* **Automation Efficiency:** Evaluation of test execution time and efficiency in detecting faults.<br>
* **Maintainability:** Consideration of how easily tests can be updated to handle changes in the software.<br>
